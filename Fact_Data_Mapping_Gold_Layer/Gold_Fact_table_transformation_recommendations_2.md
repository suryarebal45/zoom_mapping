## 1. Transformation Rules for Fact Tables

### 1.1 Meeting Facts Duration Standardization
**Rule Name:** Meeting Duration Calculation and Validation

**Description:** Transform meeting duration from Silver layer to ensure accuracy within ±1 second requirement and convert to standardized formats.

**Rationale:** Business requires precise duration calculations for billing, utilization reporting, and SLA compliance. Multiple duration formats needed for different reporting scenarios.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Transform sv_meetings to Go_Meeting_Facts duration fields
SELECT 
    meeting_id,
    host_id,
    meeting_topic,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    -- Ensure duration accuracy within ±1 second
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF('second', start_time, end_time) != (duration_minutes * 60) 
        THEN DATEDIFF('second', start_time, end_time) / 60.0
        ELSE duration_minutes
    END AS duration_minutes,
    -- Data quality check
    CASE 
        WHEN end_time >= start_time AND duration_minutes > 0 
        THEN 'VALID'
        ELSE 'INVALID_DURATION'
    END AS duration_quality_flag
FROM sv_meetings
WHERE record_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND data_quality_score >= 0.8;
```

### 1.2 Participant Count Aggregation
**Rule Name:** Accurate Participant Count Calculation

**Description:** Calculate participant_count and max_concurrent_participants with 100% accuracy requirement from participant join/leave events.

**Rationale:** Participant metrics are critical for capacity planning, billing verification, and meeting effectiveness analysis.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Calculate participant metrics for Go_Meeting_Facts
WITH participant_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        meeting_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT participant_id) AS participant_count,
        SUM(DATEDIFF('second', join_time, leave_time)) / 60.0 AS total_attendance_minutes,
        AVG(DATEDIFF('second', join_time, leave_time)) / 60.0 AS average_attendance_duration
    FROM sv_participants 
    WHERE record_status = 'ACTIVE'
        AND data_quality_score >= 0.8
        AND leave_time >= join_time
    GROUP BY meeting_id
),
concurrent_calc AS (
    SELECT 
        meeting_id,
        MAX(concurrent_count) AS max_concurrent_participants
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            meeting_id,
            event_time,
            SUM(event_type) OVER (PARTITION BY meeting_id ORDER BY event_time) AS concurrent_count
        FROM (
            SELECT meeting_id, join_time AS event_time, 1 AS event_type FROM sv_participants
            UNION ALL
            SELECT meeting_id, leave_time AS event_time, -1 AS event_type FROM sv_participants
        ) events
    ) concurrent_timeline
    GROUP BY meeting_id
)
SELECT 
    m.meeting_id,
    pm.participant_count,
    cc.max_concurrent_participants,
    pm.total_attendance_minutes,
    pm.average_attendance_duration,
    -- Data validation
    CASE 
        WHEN pm.participant_count > 0 AND cc.max_concurrent_participants > 0 
        THEN 'VALID'
        ELSE 'INVALID_PARTICIPANT_DATA'
    END AS participant_quality_flag
FROM sv_meetings m
LEFT JOIN participant_metrics pm ON m.meeting_id = pm.meeting_id
LEFT JOIN concurrent_calc cc ON m.meeting_id = cc.meeting_id;
```

### 1.3 Engagement Score Calculation
**Rule Name:** Meeting Engagement Score Derivation

**Description:** Calculate engagement_score based on participation duration, interaction frequency, and feature usage patterns.

**Rationale:** Engagement metrics are key business KPIs for measuring meeting effectiveness and user satisfaction.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Calculate engagement score for Go_Meeting_Facts
WITH engagement_components AS (
    SELECT 
        m.meeting_id,
        -- Participation rate component (0-40 points)
        LEAST(40, (AVG(DATEDIFF('second', p.join_time, p.leave_time)) / DATEDIFF('second', m.start_time, m.end_time)) * 40) AS participation_score,
        -- Feature usage component (0-30 points)
        LEAST(30, COUNT(DISTINCT fu.feature_name) * 6) AS feature_usage_score,
        -- Interaction frequency component (0-30 points)
        LEAST(30, COALESCE(SUM(fu.usage_count), 0) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT p.participant_id), 0) * 3) AS interaction_score
    FROM sv_meetings m
    LEFT JOIN sv_participants p ON m.meeting_id = p.meeting_id
    LEFT JOIN sv_feature_usage fu ON m.meeting_id = fu.meeting_id
    WHERE m.record_status = 'ACTIVE'
        AND m.data_quality_score >= 0.8
    GROUP BY m.meeting_id, m.start_time, m.end_time
)
SELECT 
    meeting_id,
    participation_score,
    feature_usage_score,
    interaction_score,
    ROUND(participation_score + feature_usage_score + interaction_score, 2) AS engagement_score,
    -- Categorize engagement level
    CASE 
        WHEN (participation_score + feature_usage_score + interaction_score) >= 80 THEN 'HIGH'
        WHEN (participation_score + feature_usage_score + interaction_score) >= 50 THEN 'MEDIUM'
        ELSE 'LOW'
    END AS engagement_level
FROM engagement_components;
```

### 1.4 Participant Facts Attendance Duration
**Rule Name:** Individual Participant Attendance Calculation

**Description:** Calculate precise attendance_duration for each participant with validation against join/leave time constraints.

**Rationale:** Individual participant metrics are essential for user behavior analysis and meeting participation tracking.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Transform sv_participants to Go_Participant_Facts
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY meeting_id, participant_id) AS participant_fact_id,
    meeting_id,
    participant_id,
    user_id,
    join_time,
    leave_time,
    -- Calculate attendance duration in minutes
    DATEDIFF('second', join_time, leave_time) / 60.0 AS attendance_duration,
    -- Derive participant role based on join sequence
    CASE 
        WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY meeting_id ORDER BY join_time) = 1 
        THEN 'HOST'
        ELSE 'PARTICIPANT'
    END AS participant_role,
    -- Data quality validation
    CASE 
        WHEN leave_time >= join_time AND DATEDIFF('second', join_time, leave_time) > 0 
        THEN 'VALID'
        WHEN leave_time < join_time THEN 'INVALID_TIME_SEQUENCE'
        WHEN DATEDIFF('second', join_time, leave_time) = 0 THEN 'ZERO_DURATION'
        ELSE 'INVALID_ATTENDANCE'
    END AS attendance_quality_flag
FROM sv_participants
WHERE record_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND data_quality_score >= 0.8
    AND join_time IS NOT NULL
    AND leave_time IS NOT NULL;
```

### 1.5 Webinar Facts Attendance Rate Calculation

-- Transform sv_webinars to Go_Webinar_Facts with calculated metrics
WITH webinar_attendance AS (
    SELECT 
        w.webinar_id,
        w.registrants,
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.participant_id) AS actual_attendees,
        MAX(concurrent_participants.max_concurrent) AS max_concurrent_attendees
    FROM sv_webinars w
    LEFT JOIN sv_participants p ON w.webinar_id = p.meeting_id
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT 
            meeting_id,
            MAX(concurrent_count) AS max_concurrent
        FROM (
            SELECT 
                meeting_id,
                SUM(event_type) OVER (PARTITION BY meeting_id ORDER BY event_time) AS concurrent_count
            FROM (
                SELECT meeting_id, join_time AS event_time, 1 AS event_type FROM sv_participants
                UNION ALL
                SELECT meeting_id, leave_time AS event_time, -1 AS event_type FROM sv_participants
            ) events
        ) concurrent_timeline
        GROUP BY meeting_id
    ) concurrent_participants ON w.webinar_id = concurrent_participants.meeting_id
    GROUP BY w.webinar_id, w.registrants
)
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY w.webinar_id) AS webinar_fact_id,
    w.webinar_id,
    w.host_id,
    w.webinar_topic,
    w.start_time,
    w.end_time,
    DATEDIFF('minute', w.start_time, w.end_time) AS duration_minutes,
    w.registrants AS registrants_count,
    wa.actual_attendees,
    -- Calculate attendance rate as percentage
    CASE 
        WHEN w.registrants > 0 
        THEN ROUND((wa.actual_attendees::FLOAT / w.registrants) * 100, 2)
        ELSE 0
    END AS attendance_rate,
    wa.max_concurrent_attendees,
    0 AS qa_questions_count,
    0 AS poll_responses_count,
    -- Basic engagement score based on attendance rate and duration
    CASE 
        WHEN w.registrants > 0 
        THEN ROUND(((wa.actual_attendees::FLOAT / w.registrants) * 50) + 
                   (LEAST(DATEDIFF('minute', w.start_time, w.end_time), 120) / 120.0 * 50), 2)
        ELSE 0
    END AS engagement_score,
    'WEBINAR' AS event_category
FROM sv_webinars w
LEFT JOIN webinar_attendance wa ON w.webinar_id = wa.webinar_id
WHERE w.record_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND w.data_quality_score >= 0.8;
```

### 1.6 Billing Facts Currency and Tax Standardization

    CASE 
        WHEN event_type IN ('Subscription Fee', 'Subscription Renewal') 
        THEN LAST_DAY(event_date)
        ELSE event_date
    END AS billing_period_end,
    'CREDIT_CARD' AS payment_method,
    CASE 
        WHEN amount > 0 AND event_type != 'Refund' THEN 'COMPLETED'
        WHEN event_type = 'Refund' THEN 'REFUNDED'
        ELSE 'PENDING'
    END AS transaction_status,
    'USD' AS currency_code,
    CASE 
        WHEN event_type NOT IN ('Refund') 
        THEN ROUND(amount * 0.08, 2)
        ELSE ROUND(amount * -0.08, 2)
    END AS tax_amount,
    0.00 AS discount_amount
FROM sv_billing_events
WHERE record_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND data_quality_score >= 0.8
    AND amount IS NOT NULL;
```

### 1.7 Usage Facts Aggregation
**Rule Name:** User Usage Metrics Daily Aggregation

**Description:** Aggregate daily usage metrics per user including meeting counts, total minutes, and feature usage.

**Rationale:** Daily usage aggregations support operational reporting, capacity planning, and user behavior analysis.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Create Go_Usage_Facts from multiple Silver layer sources
WITH daily_meeting_usage AS (
    SELECT 
        m.host_id AS user_id,
        DATE(m.start_time) AS usage_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT m.meeting_id) AS meeting_count,
        SUM(m.duration_minutes) AS total_meeting_minutes
    FROM sv_meetings m
    WHERE m.record_status = 'ACTIVE'
        AND m.data_quality_score >= 0.8
    GROUP BY m.host_id, DATE(m.start_time)
),
daily_webinar_usage AS (
    SELECT

            ELSE 80.0
        END AS video_quality_score,
        CASE 
            WHEN DATEDIFF('second', p.join_time, p.leave_time) / DATEDIFF('second', m.start_time, m.end_time)::FLOAT > 0.9 
            THEN 90.0
            ELSE 65.0
        END AS connection_stability_rating,
        100.0 AS latency_ms,
        2.5 AS packet_loss_rate,
        50.0 AS bandwidth_utilization,
        55.0 AS cpu_usage_percentage,
        750.0 AS memory_usage_mb
    FROM sv_meetings m
    JOIN sv_participants p ON m.meeting_id = p.meeting_id
    WHERE m.record_status = 'ACTIVE'
        AND p.record_status = 'ACTIVE'
        AND m.data_quality_score >= 0.8
        AND p.data_quality_score >= 0.8
)
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY meeting_id, participant_id) AS quality_fact_id,
    meeting_id,
    participant_id,
    NULL AS device_connection_id,
    ROUND(audio_quality_score, 2) AS audio_quality_score,

    ROUND(cpu_usage_percentage, 1) AS cpu_usage_percentage,
    ROUND(memory_usage_mb, 0) AS memory_usage_mb
FROM meeting_quality_base;
```

### 1.9 Data Quality and Error Handling
**Rule Name:** Comprehensive Data Quality Validation

**Description:** Implement data quality checks and error handling across all fact table transformations.

**Rationale:** Data quality is critical for accurate analytics and business decision-making. All transformations must include validation and error handling.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Data Quality Validation for Meeting Facts
SELECT 
    meeting_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN meeting_id IS NULL THEN 'MISSING_MEETING_ID'
        WHEN host_id IS NULL THEN 'MISSING_HOST_ID'
        WHEN start_time IS NULL THEN 'MISSING_START_TIME'
        WHEN end_time IS NULL THEN 'MISSING_END_TIME'
        WHEN end_time < start_time THEN 'INVALID_TIME_SEQUENCE'
        WHEN duration_minutes < 0 THEN 'NEGATIVE_DURATION'
        ELSE 'VALID'
    END AS quality_status,
    CASE 
        WHEN meeting_id IS NULL OR host_id IS NULL OR start_time IS NULL OR end_time IS NULL 
             OR end_time < start_time OR duration_minutes < 0 
        THEN 'QUARANTINE'
        ELSE 'APPROVED'
    END AS processing_status
FROM sv_meetings
WHERE record_status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### 1.10 Incremental Load Strategy
**Rule Name:** Incremental Data Processing for Fact Tables

**Description:** Implement incremental loading strategy to efficiently process only new or changed records.

**Rationale:** Incremental processing reduces processing time, resource consumption, and ensures timely data availability for reporting.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
-- Incremental Load Pattern for Go_Meeting_Facts
MERGE INTO Go_Meeting_Facts AS target
USING (
    SELECT 
        meeting_id,
        host_id,
        meeting_topic,
        start_time,
        end_time,
        duration_minutes,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS load_timestamp
    FROM sv_meetings
    WHERE update_timestamp > (
        SELECT COALESCE(MAX(update_timestamp), '1900-01-01'::TIMESTAMP)
        FROM Go_Meeting_Facts
    )
    AND record_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND data_quality_score >= 0.8
) AS source
ON target.meeting_id = source.meeting_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET
        meeting_topic = source.meeting_topic,
        duration_minutes = source.duration_minutes,
        update_timestamp = source.load_timestamp
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (
        meeting_id, host_id, meeting_topic, start_time, end_time,
        duration_minutes, load_timestamp, update_timestamp
    )
    VALUES (
        source.meeting_id, source.host_id, source.meeting_topic, 
        source.start_time, source.end_time, source.duration_minutes,
        source.load_timestamp, source.load_timestamp
    );
```
