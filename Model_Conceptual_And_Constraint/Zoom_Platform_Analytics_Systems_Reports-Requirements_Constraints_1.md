# Model Data Constraints for Zoom Platform Analytics Systems

## 1. Data Expectations

### 1.1 Data Completeness
- All meeting records must contain mandatory fields: meeting_id, host_id, start_time, end_time, meeting_topic
- Participant records must include: participant_id, meeting_id, join_time, leave_time, participant_name
- Usage metrics must be captured for all active sessions with minimum 95% completeness
- Historical data retention must maintain 100% completeness for the past 12 months
- Real-time data feeds must achieve 99.5% data capture rate

### 1.2 Data Accuracy
- Meeting duration calculations must be accurate within ±1 second
- Participant count must match actual attendees with 100% accuracy
- Timestamp data must be synchronized across all time zones with UTC standardization
- Audio/video quality metrics must reflect actual connection quality with ±5% tolerance
- Geographic location data must be accurate to country/region level

### 1.3 Data Format Standards
- All timestamps must follow ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Meeting IDs must be alphanumeric strings with consistent length (10-12 characters)
- Email addresses must follow RFC 5322 standard format
- Phone numbers must follow E.164 international format
- Duration fields must be expressed in seconds as integer values

### 1.4 Data Consistency
- User identification must be consistent across all data sources
- Meeting status values must use standardized enumeration (scheduled, started, ended, cancelled)
- Device type classifications must follow predefined taxonomy
- Quality ratings must use consistent scale (1-5 or 1-10)
- Language codes must follow ISO 639-1 standard

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Mandatory Fields
- **Meeting Entity**: meeting_id (Primary Key), host_id, start_time, meeting_topic, account_id
- **Participant Entity**: participant_id (Primary Key), meeting_id (Foreign Key), join_time, user_email
- **Usage Entity**: usage_id (Primary Key), user_id (Foreign Key), session_date, duration_minutes
- **Account Entity**: account_id (Primary Key), account_name, subscription_type, created_date
- **Device Entity**: device_id (Primary Key), device_type, operating_system, app_version

### 2.2 Uniqueness Constraints
- meeting_id must be unique across all meetings
- participant_id must be unique within each meeting session
- user_email must be unique within account scope
- account_id must be globally unique across the platform
- session_id must be unique for each user session

### 2.3 Data Type Limitations
- meeting_id: VARCHAR(12), NOT NULL
- host_id: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL
- start_time: TIMESTAMP, NOT NULL
- end_time: TIMESTAMP, NULL (for ongoing meetings)
- duration_minutes: INTEGER, CHECK (duration_minutes >= 0)
- participant_count: INTEGER, CHECK (participant_count >= 0 AND participant_count <= 1000)
- quality_score: DECIMAL(3,2), CHECK (quality_score >= 0.00 AND quality_score <= 10.00)

### 2.4 Dependencies
- Participant records cannot exist without corresponding meeting record
- Usage metrics depend on valid user and meeting associations
- Quality metrics require corresponding session data
- Billing records must reference valid account and usage data
- Device information must be linked to valid user sessions

### 2.5 Referential Integrity
- meeting.host_id must reference valid user.user_id
- participant.meeting_id must reference valid meeting.meeting_id
- usage.user_id must reference valid user.user_id
- meeting.account_id must reference valid account.account_id
- session.device_id must reference valid device.device_id

### 2.6 Temporal Constraints
- end_time must be greater than or equal to start_time
- leave_time must be greater than or equal to join_time
- session_date must not be in the future
- created_date must not be modified after initial insert
- last_updated timestamp must be automatically maintained

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Operational Rules
- **Meeting Lifecycle**: Meetings must progress through defined states (scheduled → started → ended/cancelled)
- **Participant Limits**: Maximum 1000 participants per meeting for enterprise accounts, 100 for basic accounts
- **Session Duration**: Maximum meeting duration of 24 hours, automatic termination after 30 hours
- **Data Retention**: Raw meeting data retained for 12 months, aggregated data retained for 7 years
- **Access Control**: User data access restricted based on account hierarchy and permissions

### 3.2 Reporting Logic
- **Active Users**: Users with at least one session in the reporting period
- **Meeting Utilization**: Calculated as (actual duration / scheduled duration) * 100
- **Quality Metrics**: Averaged across all participants for meeting-level reporting
- **Peak Usage**: Calculated based on concurrent meeting participants during business hours
- **Engagement Score**: Derived from participation duration, interaction frequency, and feature usage

### 3.3 Data Processing Rules
- **Real-time Processing**: Critical metrics updated within 5 minutes of event occurrence
- **Batch Processing**: Historical aggregations processed daily during off-peak hours
- **Data Validation**: All incoming data validated against schema before storage
- **Error Handling**: Invalid records logged and quarantined for manual review
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic deduplication based on composite key matching

### 3.4 Transformation Guidelines
- **Time Zone Normalization**: All timestamps converted to UTC for storage, localized for reporting
- **Data Aggregation**: Metrics aggregated at multiple levels (user, account, organization, global)
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers masked in non-production environments
- **Data Enrichment**: Geographic and demographic data appended where available
- **Quality Scoring**: Composite scores calculated using weighted algorithms

### 3.5 Compliance Rules
- **Privacy Protection**: Personal data handling must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and regional regulations
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and retain data necessary for business purposes
- **Audit Trail**: All data modifications must be logged with user identification and timestamp
- **Data Export**: Users must be able to export their personal data upon request
- **Right to Deletion**: Personal data must be removable while maintaining referential integrity

### 3.6 Performance Rules
- **Query Response Time**: Standard reports must complete within 30 seconds
- **Data Freshness**: Real-time dashboards updated within 5 minutes
- **Concurrent Users**: System must support 1000+ concurrent report users
- **Data Volume**: Architecture must handle 10TB+ of historical data
- **Backup Recovery**: Data recovery must be possible within 4-hour RTO
