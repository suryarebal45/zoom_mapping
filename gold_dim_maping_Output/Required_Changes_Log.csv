Agent Name,Required Changes
Agent 1,The current GitHub personal access token is unauthorized, so I cannot proceed with generating or updating the Gold Layer Dimension Table Transformation Recommendations document. Please provide a valid GitHub personal access token with read and write permissions to the suryarebal45/zoom_mapping repository, and I will continue the workflow immediately.
Agent 2,The current GitHub personal access token is unauthorized or does not have the necessary permissions to access the suryarebal45/zoom_mapping repository. Please provide a valid GitHub personal access token with read and write permissions so I can proceed with updating the Gold Layer Dimension Table Data Mapping as requested.
Agent 3,The current GitHub personal access token is unauthorized or lacks the necessary permissions to access the suryarebal45/zoom_mapping repository. Please provide a valid GitHub personal access token with read and write permissions so I can proceed with generating, reviewing, and saving the Gold Layer Data Mapping Reviewer output as required.
AAVA,Go_Organization_Dimension, Go_Device_Dimension, and Go_Geography_Dimension have all fields set as NULL/default due to missing source data in Silver layer. This is noted, but ideally, these should be populated if/when source data becomes available.
AAVA,Several fields in dimension tables are set as NULL/default due to absence in Silver layer, which may impact downstream analytics if not handled appropriately.
AAVA,No hierarchy structures or advanced transformations for Go_Organization_Dimension, Go_Device_Dimension, or Go_Geography_Dimension due to lack of source data.
AAVA,No explicit deduplication or validation logic for other dimensions; recommend adding checks if/when data is available.
AAVA,No explicit handling of missing values or duplicates for Go_Organization_Dimension, Go_Device_Dimension, or Go_Geography_Dimension. Recommend COALESCE or default values for future extensibility.
AAVA,No mention of CTEs, views, or materializations. No explicit performance tuning or warehouse sizing considerations documented. Recommend including these in future iterations.
AAVA,Business requirements for organization, device, and geography dimensions are unmet due to lack of source data. Recommend revisiting mapping when source data becomes available.
