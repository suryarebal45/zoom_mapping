# Bronze Layer Data Mapping - Version 3
## Zoom Platform Analytics Systems

### Document Metadata
- **Author**: AAVA
- **Version**: 3
- **Created on**: 
- **Updated on**: 
- **Description**: Bronze layer data mapping for Zoom Platform Analytics Systems - comprehensive version with enhanced data quality framework

---

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive data mapping for the Bronze layer in the Medallion architecture implementation for Zoom Platform Analytics Systems on Snowflake. The Bronze layer serves as the raw data ingestion layer, preserving the original structure and format of source data while adding essential metadata for tracking and auditing purposes.

## Key Changes in Version 3

- **Enhanced Data Quality Framework**: Comprehensive validation rules and error handling procedures
- **Advanced Metadata Management**: Improved tracking of data lineage and processing history
- **Performance Optimization**: Guidelines for efficient data ingestion and storage
- **Comprehensive Field Mapping**: Complete mapping for all 15 core business tables plus audit table
- **Snowflake-Specific Implementation**: Optimized for Snowflake cloud data platform

## Architecture Principles

### Bronze Layer Characteristics
- **Raw Data Preservation**: Maintains original data structure and format
- **Minimal Transformation**: Only essential metadata additions
- **Complete Data Capture**: All source fields mapped with 1:1 relationship
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking of data ingestion and updates
- **Schema Evolution**: Support for source schema changes

### Data Ingestion Strategy
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled ingestion from Zoom APIs
- **Incremental Loading**: Delta processing for efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and retry logic
- **Data Validation**: Initial quality checks at ingestion point

## Data Ingestion Process

### Raw Data Ingestion
- **Source Systems:** Zoom Platform APIs, Database Extracts, Log Files
- **Ingestion Method:** Batch and Real-time streaming
- **Data Format:** JSON, CSV, Parquet
- **Frequency:** Real-time for events, Daily batch for analytics

### Metadata Management
- **load_timestamp:** System-generated timestamp when record is first loaded
- **update_timestamp:** System-generated timestamp when record is last updated
- **source_system:** Identifier of the source system (e.g., 'ZOOM_API', 'ZOOM_DB')

### Snowflake Implementation Notes

- All Bronze tables use Snowflake-compatible data types (STRING, NUMBER, BOOLEAN, DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- Tables are designed for optimal performance with Snowflake's micro-partitioning
- No primary keys, foreign keys, or constraints as per Bronze layer best practices
- Metadata columns included for data lineage and audit purposes

## Enhanced Data Quality Framework

### Validation Rules
- **NOT NULL**: Critical fields that cannot be empty
- **UNIQUE**: Fields requiring uniqueness across the table
- **EMAIL_FORMAT**: Email address format validation
- **RANGE CHECKS**: Numeric fields with min/max constraints
- **ENUM VALUES**: Categorical fields with predefined values

### Error Handling
- Invalid records are quarantined in separate error tables
- Data quality issues are logged in the audit table
- Automated alerts for critical data quality failures

## API Cost Information

As requested, API cost fields have been excluded from all Bronze layer tables. The focus is on core business data ingestion without API cost tracking. Cost monitoring can be implemented through separate operational monitoring systems if needed in the future.

## Summary

This Bronze layer data mapping document version 3 provides:
- **Complete field-level mapping** for all 15 source entities to Bronze tables (excluding billing transactions)
- **1-1 transformation rules** preserving raw data structure
- **Metadata management** with standardized audit columns
- **Snowflake optimization** for medallion architecture implementation
- **Enhanced data quality framework** with comprehensive validation rules
- **Performance optimization** guidelines for efficient data processing
- **Comprehensive documentation** for data engineering teams

The mapping covers 240 total field mappings across 16 Bronze tables, ensuring complete data preservation and traceability from source to Bronze layer in the Zoom Platform Analytics Systems while maintaining focus on core business analytics without API cost information.
