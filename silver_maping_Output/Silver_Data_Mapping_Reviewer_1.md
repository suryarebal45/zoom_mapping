# Executive Summary
This review evaluates the Silver Layer Data Mapping (Bronze → Silver) for the Zoom Platform Analytics Systems in Snowflake. The mapping is assessed for correctness, efficiency, and compliance with Snowflake standards, ensuring robust data quality, business rule coverage, and auditability.

# Methodology
The review covers:
- Detailed mapping validation for all Silver Layer tables
- Data consistency and transformation checks
- Validation rule completeness
- Compliance with Snowflake best practices
- Audit and error handling mechanisms
- Business requirements alignment
- Data lineage and documentation
- Null handling and edge cases

Inputs include the Bronze and Silver Physical Data Models, process table, requirements, and Data Quality recommendations.

# Findings
## 3.1 Data Consistency
✅ All primary and foreign key relationships are explicitly mapped and validated.
✅ Uniqueness and not-null constraints are enforced for key fields (user_id, meeting_id, etc.).
✅ Referential integrity checks between tables (e.g., host_id in Meetings to Users).
❌ No explicit fallback logic for missing foreign keys in some mappings (recommend adding COALESCE or error quarantine).

## 3.2 Transformations
✅ Transformations use Snowflake-compliant functions (TRIM, LOWER, TO_TIMESTAMP_NTZ, etc.).
✅ Domain standardization for plan_type, feature_name, ticket_type, etc.
✅ Data quality score derived from DQ checks.
❌ Some transformation rules (e.g., error handling for out-of-range times) could be more granular.

## 3.3 Validation Rules
✅ Validation rules cover uniqueness, not-null, domain values, referential integrity, and temporal consistency.
✅ SQL examples provided for each rule.
✅ Error quarantine for invalid records.
❌ Some business rules (e.g., participant limits) are documented but not mapped to transformation logic—recommend explicit implementation.

## 3.4 Compliance with Best Practices (Snowflake)
✅ Schema design follows Snowflake conventions (supported data types, TIMESTAMP_NTZ usage).
✅ Metadata columns (load_date, update_date, source_system) are present in all tables.
✅ Audit and error tables ensure traceability.
✅ PII masking validation included for non-production environments.
✅ Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, SOX.
❌ Clustering/micro-partitioning strategies not explicitly documented—recommend adding.

## 3.5 Business Requirements Alignment
✅ Mapping reflects all business rules and reporting requirements from requirements and DQ recommendations.
✅ Data retention and completeness checks included.
✅ Business rule-based checks (e.g., meeting participant limits, session duration) are documented.
❌ Automated correction logic for known error patterns could be expanded.

## 3.6 Error Handling and Logging
✅ Invalid records are quarantined in Si_Data_Quality_Errors.
✅ Error types, descriptions, and remediation actions are logged.
✅ Audit table tracks process execution, errors, and record counts.
✅ Alerts and summary reports based on error rates.
❌ Error handling for edge cases (e.g., nulls in derived fields) could be more explicit.

## 3.7 Effective Data Mapping
✅ All Silver Layer tables have detailed attribute-level mapping from Bronze Layer.
✅ Derived fields (data_quality_score, record_status) are calculated and mapped.
✅ Mapping ensures traceability and compliance.
❌ Some mappings (e.g., inferred logic for derived fields) could benefit from additional documentation.

## 3.8 Data Quality
✅ High-quality data ensured via comprehensive validation and transformation rules.
✅ Data lineage and audit trail documented.
✅ Error quarantine and remediation actions defined.
❌ Data duplication checks could be expanded for edge cases.

# Recommendations
- Add explicit fallback logic (COALESCE, default values) for missing foreign keys and nulls.
- Document clustering/micro-partitioning strategies for performance optimization.
- Expand automated correction logic for known error patterns.
- Enhance documentation for derived fields and inferred logic.
- Increase granularity of error handling for edge cases.
- Expand duplication checks for high-volume tables.
