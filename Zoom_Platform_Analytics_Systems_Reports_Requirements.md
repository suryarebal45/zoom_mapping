## 1. PLATFORM USAGE & ADOPTION REPORT

### Business Objective
Monitor user engagement and platform adoption rates to identify growth trends and areas for improvement.

### Uses of the Report
- Track key usage metrics like total meeting minutes and active users.
- Identify trends in new user sign-ups and meeting creation.
- Analyze usage patterns by user plan type (e.g., Free vs. Paid).
- Assess the adoption of new features.

### Data Relationships Used
- Meetings   Users (via Host_ID)
- Attendees  Meetings (via Meeting_ID)
- Features_Usage  Meetings (via Meeting_ID)

### Data Attributes in the Report
- User information (User_ID, Plan_Type)
- Meeting information (Meeting_ID, Duration_Minutes, Start_Time)
- Usage details (Feature_Name, Usage_Count)
- Calculated metrics (Total_Meeting_Minutes, Active_Users_Count)

### KPIs and Metrics in the Report
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Total meeting minutes per day
- Average meeting duration
- Number of meetings created per user
- New user sign-ups over time
- Feature adoption rate

### Calculations in the Report
- The total number of meeting minutes is determined by adding up the duration (in minutes) of all meetings.
- The average meeting duration is found by averaging the duration across all meetings.
- The active user count is the number of unique users who have hosted at least one meeting.
- The feature adoption rate measures the proportion of users who have used a specific feature at least once, compared to the total user base.

### Data Constraints
- Duration_Minutes must be a non-negative integer.
- Start_Time and End_Time must be valid timestamps.
- A Meeting_ID in Attendees or Features_Usage must exist in the Meetings table.

### Visualizations
- Line chart showing DAU/WAU/MAU trends.
- Bar chart comparing average meeting duration by Plan_Type.
- Pie chart showing feature usage distribution.

### Access Control Requirements
- Product Managers: Full access to feature adoption and user behavior data.
- Marketing Team: Access to new user and plan-type data.
- Executives: Aggregated view of key usage metrics with drill-down capability.

## 2. SERVICE RELIABILITY & SUPPORT REPORT

### Business Objective
Analyze platform stability and customer support interactions to improve service quality and reduce ticket volume.

### Uses of the Report
- Identify products or features that generate the most support tickets.
- Track ticket resolution times and patterns.
- Correlate meeting issues with ticket types.
- Assess the efficiency of the support team.

### Data Relationships Used
- Support_Tickets   Users (via User_ID)
- Support_Tickets   Meetings (implied link, not direct FK)

### Data Attributes in the Report
- Ticket information (Ticket_ID, Ticket_Type, Resolution_Status, Open_Date)
- User information (User_ID, Company)
- Calculated metrics (Average_Resolution_Time, Ticket_Volume_by_Type)

### KPIs and Metrics in the Report
- Number of tickets opened per day/week.
- Average ticket resolution time.
- Most common ticket types (e.g., audio issues, connectivity problems).
- First-contact resolution rate.
- Tickets opened per 1,000 active users.

### Calculations in the Report
- The ticket volume by type shows how many tickets were created for each type of issue.
- The average resolution time is calculated by determining the average time taken to close a ticket after it was opened.
- The user-to-ticket ratio compares the total number of tickets raised to the number of active users during the same period.

### Data Constraints
- Ticket_Type and Resolution_Status must be from a predefined list of values.
- User_ID must exist in the Users table.
- Open_Date must be a valid date.

### Visualizations
- Bar chart showing ticket volume by Ticket_Type.
- Line chart tracking average resolution time over time.
- Donut chart showing Resolution_Status distribution.

### Access Control Requirements
- Support Team Leads: Full access to all ticket data for their team.
- Product & Engineering Teams: Access to ticket types related to their features/products.
- Executives: High-level summary of ticket volume and resolution metrics.
